# MOTIVATION
At the beginning of 2017 [Telnic](https://www.do.tel/) has renewed Telhosting platform. Unfortunately new hosting was much worser than former. Good news are that .tel zone has become a regular TLD so **\<zone>.tld** can be delegated. This engine was made as replacement of Telhosting for delegated .tel domains.
