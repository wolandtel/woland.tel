# MOTIVATION
At the beginning of 2017 [Telnic](https://www.do.tel/) has renewed its Telhosting platform. Unfortunately, the new hosting was much worse than the former. The good news is that the .tel zone has become a regular TLD so **\<zone>.tld** can be delegated. This engine was made as a replacement for Telhosting for delegated .tel domains.
